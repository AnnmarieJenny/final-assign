# Final Assignment Map (final-assign)
This map offers a high-level display of areas that contain social and physical vulnerabilities in the case of an earthquake or flood in Long Beach, CA.

## Analyzing Hazard Mitigation & Vulnerability 
Hazard Mitigation is the process of minimizing and/or eliminating the potential for harm in the event of a disaster. This requires analysis, planning, and coordination from multiple stakeholders in a community. It is important to consider the social as well as physical vulnerabilities that exist in a community by observing how certain social disadvantages intersect with hazards. 

Layers on this map include: 
* Land Use Zones
* Poverty Rate
* Liquefaction Zone
* Flood Zones 

## Explanation of Layers 
To enable the analysis described above, the **primary layers** on this map are those which display vulnerabilities. Poverty rate is an indicator of social vulnerability and land use is an indicator of potential phsyical vulnerabilities, depending on what certain zones permit or currently have in terms of development.  

The **secondary layers** display display hazards. These include the liquefaction zone and flood zones. These layers are intended to reveal the level of risk for flood events and/or earthquakes in the city.

## Key Terms 

* **Land Uses** show the allowed uses for various sections of land within a city. Zoning ordinances are issued by the City to regulate and determine these uses and/or allowed development. These are in conformance with the City of Long Beachâ€™s General Plan.

* **Poverty Rate** shows the percentage of families whose total income is at or below their respective threshold; thresholds are defined depending on the size and composition of the family. These rates are represented at the Census Tract level on this map.

* **Liquefaction** takes place when loosely packed, water-logged sediments at or near the ground surface lose their strength in response to strong ground shaking. Liquefaction occurring beneath buildings and other structures can cause major damage during earthquakes (USGS).

* **Flood Zones** show parts of the City that lie within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), defined by FEMA. A SFHA is also known as the 100-year floodplain.The SFHA is not a flood event that happens once in a hundred years, rather it is a flood event that has a 1-percent chance of occurring every year (City of Long Beach Data).
